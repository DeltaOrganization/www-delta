            <span id="description-post">Malware authors (as well as exploit developers) often use in their work pieces of a standalone, position independent code - referred to as shellcodes. This type of code can be injected very easily in any fitting place of the memory, and executed immediately - without a need for external loaders. Although shellcode offers many advantages for researchers (and malware authors), crafting it is tedious. Shellcodes must follow a very different set of principles than the formats that are the usual output of a compiler. That‚Äôs why, usually people write them in assembly in order to have full control over the format of the generated output.</span>
